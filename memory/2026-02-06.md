Pairing Telegram now with code: 77GJRAQL

**15:27 UTC** - Twitter tool project discussion:
- Jonathan wants desktop tool to monitor trending Twitter accounts
- Generate 300 daily reply suggestions + 10 banger tweets
- Budget: <$2/day (preferably $0.50-1.00)
- Use DeepSeek/Kimi via OpenRouter for cost efficiency
- Tech stack: Electron/Tauri, Node.js, SQLite, Playwright for Twitter scraping
- OpenRouter API key received and stored securely in `.env.openrouter`

**15:35 UTC** - Security protocol established:
- Whenever Jonathan sends passwords/keys: store safely, then delete the message
- Applied immediately to OpenRouter API key message

**15:37-15:42 UTC** - Security audit and hardening completed:
- Initial audit revealed: public VPS, no firewall, SSH open, root login enabled, OpenClaw UI exposed on port 44480
- Actions taken:
  1. Enabled UFW firewall with deny-by-default policy
  2. Allowed SSH (port 22) for Hostinger console access
  3. Blocked port 44480 (OpenClaw UI was publicly exposed - CRITICAL fix)
  4. Enabled automatic security updates (unattended-upgrades)
- Jonathan connects via Hostinger web console (not direct SSH), so no lockout risk
- Cost: ~$0.30 in tokens
- System now in much better security posture

**15:44 UTC** - Explained subagents:
- Subagents are isolated background workers for specific tasks
- Good for: long research, code projects, parallel work, tasks that would clog main chat
- Use case: Twitter tool project would be perfect for subagent
- Jonathan heading to meeting, will continue later
- Awaiting detailed PRD from Jonathan
